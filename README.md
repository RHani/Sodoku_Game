# Sodoku_Game
Sudoku is a popular Japanese puzzle game based on the logical placement of numbers. Being a game of logic, Sudoku doesn’t require any calculation nor special math skills
The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
A well-constructed Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options.
